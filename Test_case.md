## Test1

### Purpose of this case
To check whether the program will output nothing if all N inputs are negative.

### Case input
    2
    -1 -1

### Expected result
    (Nothing will be output)

## Test2

### Purpose of this case
	To check whether the smallest number will be taken if there are multiple choice.

### Case input
	7
	0 1 2 3 4 5 6

### Expected result
	0 1 2 3 4 5 6

## Test3

### Purpose of this case
To check whether the program will correctly handle collisions.

### Case input
	10
	13 3 -1 83 73 63 53 43 33 23

### Expected result
	83 73 63 53 43 33 23 13 3

## Test4

### Purpose of this case
To check whether the program can deal with a large input.
In this case, 1000 distinct random numbers ranging from 0 to 4999 are generated by a Python script, and hashed with the hash function H(x) = x%1000 using linear probing.
### Case input and expected result
One can find the input of this case in the file 'input.txt' (which actually is the output of hash routine), and the expected output in 'expected_output.txt ' (which is actually the random numbers generated by the Python script).

By using the Shell command diff, one can determine whether the reconstruct function is correct or not.
