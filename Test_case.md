## Test1

### Purpose of this case
To check whether the program will output nothing if all N inputs are negative.

### Case input
    2
    -1 -1

### Expected result
    (Nothing will be output)

## Test2

### Purpose of this case
	To check whether the smallest number will be taken if there are multiple choice.

### Case input
	7
	0 1 2 3 4 5 6

### Expected result
	0 1 2 3 4 5 6

## Test3

### Purpose of this case
To check whether the program will correctly handle collisions.

### Case input
	10
	13 3 -1 83 73 63 53 43 33 23

### Expected result
	83 73 63 53 43 33 23 13 3

## Test4

### Purpose of this case
To check whether the program can deal with the input of exactly 1000 numbers.

In this case, 1000 distinct random numbers ranging from 0 to 9999 are generated, sorted with increasing order, and hashed with the hash function `H(x) = x % 1000` using linear probing by a Python script.

It is guaranteed that there are some collisions. (There are 6 numbers congruent module 1000 with the remainder of 925, e.g.)

### Input case and expected result
One can find the input of this case in the file 'test4_input.txt' (which is actually the output of hash routine), and the expected output in 'test4_expected_result.txt' (which is actually the sorted random numbers generated by the Python script).

By comparing expected result and actual output using the Shell command diff, one can determine whether the reconstruct function is correct or not.
